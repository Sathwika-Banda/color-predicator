## Color Prediction with Neural Networks

This project implements a simple neural network using TensorFlow and Keras to predict colors based on random input data.

## Overview

The goal is to demonstrate how to create a basic neural network for color prediction. It generates random colors as input and predicts corresponding random labels. Results are visualized using Matplotlib.

## Installation

To run this project, you need Python and the following libraries:

- numpy
- tensorflow
- matplotlib

Install the required libraries using pip:


pip install numpy tensorflow matplotlib
